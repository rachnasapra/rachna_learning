What are the most common amenities? Also which most liked and unliked one-There are some things found during Analysis like most popular amnesties and least popular amenities ?
What attracts the guests most for renting a property in 30, 60, 90 booking days buckets?
What are the most influential features of the dataset to estimate the price of a listing?



Data Understanding 
I then moved to different datsets and find which can be better compared as there were 3 datsets listing , calendar and reviews. Calendar were having data for different dates
